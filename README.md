# Maze_Generator

This is a project that will generate a maze in C++

The goal of this project is to act as a prototype for a maze generator plug-in that I will be making for Unreal Engine

This maze generator will be using DFS for now to generate the maze once That is done I will add more path finding algorithms to make mazes.

I am currently working on the maze solver, the mazes in the project right now were generated by chatGPT.
